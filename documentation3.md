## Simple dialogues

We add simple frazes, which saw NPC, when player talk to them. NPC always rotates to the player when speaks.

## Quest and items

Some of the items are active and player could put them to the inventory. Only one item could be in inventory at the same time.
Type of the inventory item always appears on the User Interface.

Some of the items are important and could be used in the 'bring me something' quests. After completing the quest you could receive a new item.
